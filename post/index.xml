      <description>Two weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and creator of Facebook, posted a 3000 word document introducing a new vision of the future for his companies. A lot has been written about it (some good examples are here, here, and here). But the gist of the document is a move towards privacy and away from a public social network. In his words, to move the conversation from the public square, and allow &amp;ldquo;to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room.</description>

      <description>Sense About Science is a charity that promotes proper use of science and evidence in the public sphere. As stated on its website, it looks to intervene to hold “those responsible to account”. One of their latest ventures is called Evidence Week. The premise of the event is to bring together Members of Parliament with community members and other interested parties to discuss the need and use of evidence in policy-making.</description>

      <description>It has been argued that one of the things that allow the human race to go as far as it does is our ability to communicate and produce knowledge through argumentation. When doing my undergrad a friend used to say that we don’t really think until when we write it somewhere and make sure it makes sense (in some way, this blog is an exercise in articulation). Alternatively, I recently heard someone say that we should not believe things we are exposed to until we understand them, regardless of where they come from.</description>

      <description>At every point in time, people have probably claimed that ‘we are going through the most important moment in the history of mankind’. So I am going to go ahead and say that this is at very least, one of the most important moments in the history of mankind. With the advent of technology and computational power, algorithms determine most of the processes that shape our everyday lives. There are increasingly fewer situations in which our decisions are not influenced by a computer program ‘suggesting’ how we should go about our day.</description>
